  <h3>CUBA CRISIS OVER?</h3>
  <h3>KHRUSHCHEV CONFIRMS MISSILES TO BE REMOVED, SAC DEFCON LOWERED TO 2</h3>

  <article>
    <p>Yesterday the Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev confirmed that the bases in Cuba were to be dismantled under United Nations verification, in accordance with the U.S. agreeing not to stage an invasion of Cuba.</p>

    <p><strong>WASHINGTON, D.C., Oct. 30, 1962 —</strong> A light sense of eased tension hangs over Washington, Europe, and the globe today, after Premier Krushchev’s announcement on Sunday that offensive missile bases in Cuba are to be dismantled under verification by the U.N. After two weeks poised on the edge of an unimaginable conflict, the Soviet Union appears to have stepped back from the brink. However, amidst the relief, pressing questions remain, such as if the danger has truly passed or is this just for show?</p>

    <p>The crisis, which entered into public view just over a few days ago, began escalating over a week earlier. When unbeknownst to the public, the Air Force was utilizing high-altitude U-2 reconnaissance aircraft, and gathered startling photographic evidence in mid-October confirming the secret construction of Soviet medium-range and intermediate-range missile sites in Cuba, which are capable of striking nearly all of the continental United States.</p>

    <p>President Kennedy who was informed by his special national security advisor of the situation, and of the "incontrovertible evidence" on October the 16th, after which he "indicated" who would have to be convened for the "Executive Committee of the National Security Council" to discuss what to do. Intense deliberations followed with options ranging from air strikes to a blockade, ultimately deciding on a naval blockade of Cuba to prevent any further military shipments. This "Quarantine" was announced to the nation and world on October 22nd in a speech by the President.</p>

    <p>The next couple days were dangerous. Soviet ships sailed towards the blockade, and U.S. forces remained on high alert. Washington and Moscow talked constantly, culminating in Premier Khrushchev’s agreement to remove the missiles in exchange for a U.S. pledge not to invade Cuba.</p>

    <p>The immediate threat of a military confrontation seems to have left for now, officials are urging caution. The process of dismantling the sites and verifying the removal of all offensive weapons, including Soviet IL-28 bombers has not began in earnest. Until verification is complete and the weapons are gone, the shadow of this crisis will linger. And the world will watch, hoping this fragile peace holds, while hopefully understanding how close we were to disaster.</p>
